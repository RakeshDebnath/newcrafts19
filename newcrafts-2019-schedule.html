The UX designer, the product owner, the manager, the tester, the agile coach and others can try their best to influence outcomes but it doesn’t matter if the programmer is not on board. Only the programmer decides which if-statements get written and how long it will take. Without the programmer, there is no software. Without the software, there is no company. But as the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. One of those responsibilities is to acknowledge this power and use it for good. Good for the human beings working with you, good for the company, good for your own health and good for society.</p>

Using the latest in Deep Learning techniques, we can generate code that’s not just functional, but beautiful. Our goal is to make the computer do the heavy lifting so you can concentrate on the important things: being creative, solving problems, and having fun.We’ve tried a hundred different ways of encoding the knowledge of <em>how</em> to write code. In this talk, Samir will take you through a tour of the different techniques, architectures and optimisations we’ve tried in the process of teaching a machine to write code, using neural networks, simulations and everything in between.</p>

The paper shows the decomposition and reconstruction of Escher's woodcutting "Square Limit", a beautiful recursive tessellation of interleaving fish, using functional programming. We will define a set of functions that operate on pictures - transforming them and composing them into more complex pictures. With these functions implemented, we will follow in Henderson's footsteps to create a replica of Escher's Square Limit as an SVG. We will use Elm as the implementation language.</p>

Other companies are still struggling with estimations and slowly thinking about going microservices. Other are happy with their monolith, but struggling with recruiting.</p>
<p>We’re all developers, but we’re not doing the same job. The line connecting a problem to its solution is relatively straight in some organizations and incredibly convoluted in some hours.</p>
<p>Processes, Software architectures and Organization are not separate concerns, neither are orthogonal. Pretending to fix one thing without touching others is a losing battle.</p>
<p>We’re part of the problem. Our software is part of the problem. We can be part of the solution too.</p>

The UX designer, the product owner, the manager, the tester, the agile coach and others can try their best to influence outcomes but it doesn’t matter if the programmer is not on board. Only the programmer decides which if-statements get written and how long it will take. Without the programmer, there is no software. Without the software, there is no company. But as the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. One of those responsibilities is to acknowledge this power and use it for good. Good for the human beings working with you, good for the company, good for your own health and good for society.</p>

                                        </p><p>Functional Programming is often seen as a nice tool for small-scale concerns, not as a tool for application design. "Functional in the small, OO in the large" is often heard and sums up this idea quite well. However, functional programming comes with interesting tools aimed at solving these boring (or deemed boring) concerns: dependency inversion, observability). Aspect-Oriented-Programming is often used for this in the OO word. </p>
<p>A functional solution, called a <em>monad stack</em>, allows to combine all this cross-cutting concerns and behaviours with no magic (or not too much). </p>
<p>In this conference, we'll see what <em>monad transformers</em> are, how they work, and how to use them to structure a web application, with examples in scala and haskell.</p>

                                        </p><p>Security isn't very fun for development teams to think about. It's complex and something that isn't brought to mind when considering requirements. Too often, it neglected by teams and left to the end for penetration testers to consider. But, it doesn't have to be. Security can be considered early in the development cycle. How can we encourage this behaviour? How can you get development teams interested?</p>
<p>Security is an important skill to possess while delivering quality software. The cost of not having security skills within teams is now more obvious than ever. Security should be in the forefront of development teams minds. Even with these risks, data leaks and denial of service attacks are in the headlines often. How do we stop our companies being another statistic?</p>
<p>Learning should not be compulsory. Especially if you want something to become part of the culture. Beginning with a simple workshop to expanding to a security guild, people were eager to be involved. This lead to further workshops which included the basics of threat modelling using STRIDE to the complexity of automated checks. Security at Sky became not only fun but cool. Security was no longer a rarely thought about requirement but a fun, oft thought about need.</p>

                                        </p><p>After some project experience, you would think software development is about feature branches and pull requests, sprints, deadlines and tardy code, brittleness and tech debt, JIRA and PMs, heroic teammates, and stress. It has to be that way as these are all byproducts of some hidden axioms.</p>
<p>Welcome to my new world where axioms are reversed and parallel lines cross! Ever since I joined my mob team and started practicing Extreme Programming, I have been slowly tossing out of the window everything I know so far about software delivery.  Fresh, newcomer perspective is short-lived and high-value, and I would like to share my amazement at this non-Euclidean way of delivering software, before it becomes the new norm for me.</p>

In this talk, you will be guided to railroad tracks - web app designed and implemented functionally using heavily Either Monads. Everything is either a Success or Error, or rather a Future of Success or Errors. 
During the talk, few monads are discussed, like Maybe and Either, using examples from SanctuaryJS (which is used in the app). Also some good practices that makes the domain code easy to understand.
The talk will be based on real code that runs in production.</p>

Other companies are still struggling with estimations and slowly thinking about going microservices. Other are happy with their monolith, but struggling with recruiting.</p>
<p>We’re all developers, but we’re not doing the same job. The line connecting a problem to its solution is relatively straight in some organizations and incredibly convoluted in some hours.</p>
<p>Processes, Software architectures and Organization are not separate concerns, neither are orthogonal. Pretending to fix one thing without touching others is a losing battle.</p>
<p>We’re part of the problem. Our software is part of the problem. We can be part of the solution too.</p>

The UX designer, the product owner, the manager, the tester, the agile coach and others can try their best to influence outcomes but it doesn’t matter if the programmer is not on board. Only the programmer decides which if-statements get written and how long it will take. Without the programmer, there is no software. Without the software, there is no company. But as the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. One of those responsibilities is to acknowledge this power and use it for good. Good for the human beings working with you, good for the company, good for your own health and good for society.</p>

TCR is an alternative to TDD that enforce even more extreme rules than TDD. The goal of this talk is to present the principles, pros and cons according to my experience with TCR.
Every point will be illustrated with examples. Finally, we'll try to adapt TCR a bit in order to mitigate the identified cons.</p>

                                        </p><p>"We're looking for passionate programmers!" says the job ad. For a love-in or a development role? <em>Passion</em> is used to evoke single-mindedness, drive and intensity, but it also has many other meanings, surely not all of which can be intended. Love aside, passion also spills over into irrationality, aggression — e.g., crimes of passion — and unconditional and unquestioning pursuit of ideas. Our acceptance of this word and this quality should be partial and conditional. But there is more than one kind of passion, and when raw passion is tempered with compassion and dispassion we start to see a more balanced way of development.</p>
<p>Good development draws on both creativity and rationality, on both experience and experimentation, on both focus and connection, on both individual skill and group intelligence. The dry language of productivity needs to admit the possibility of enjoyment; the culture of burn-out needs to give way to humanity and empathy. Let's explore the many passions of programming.</p>

                                        </p><p>There’s nothing more frustrating than not being able to deliver new features because of unnecessarily complicated code. A fast deployment pipeline is of no use if the code itself is too hard and slow to change.</p>
<p>You may decide it’s time to throw it all away and start over… and what began full of optimism, drags on for months and years, adding even more complexity and various levels of legacy.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be this way! In this presentation, you’ll hear a first-hand experience of how to approach technical debt in an iterative way. This talk will teach you lessons on how to start, and most importantly, finish a big rewrite project.</p>
<p>You will learn how to approach the conversation with the "business", avoid the most common pitfalls when changing the architecture of a complex codebase, and ensure the rewrite brings value from the start till the very happy end.</p>

                                        </p><p>How should you actually implement Continuous Delivery?</p>
<p>Adopting Continuous Delivery takes time. You have a long list of technology and organisational changes to consider. You have to work within the unique circumstances of your organisation. You’re constantly surrounded by strange problems, half-baked theories, off the shelf solutions that just don’t work, and people telling you they’ve worked here for 23 years and Amazon is nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>How do you identify and remove the major impediments in your build, testing, and operational activities? How do you avoid spending weeks, months, or years on far-reaching changes that ultimately have no impact on your time to market?</p>
<p>The Theory of Constraints is a management paradigm that describes how to improve throughput in a homogeneous workflow. It can be applied to Continuous Delivery in order to locate, prioritise, and reduceconstrained activities until a flow of release candidates to production is achieved.</p>
<p>In this talk, Steve Smith will explain how easy it is for a Continuous Delivery programme to be unsuccessful, how the Theory Of Constraints works, how to apply the Five Focussing Steps to Continuous Delivery, and how to home in on the constrained activities that are your keys to success. It includes tales of glorious failures and ignominious successes when adopting Continuous Delivery.</p>

Other companies are still struggling with estimations and slowly thinking about going microservices. Other are happy with their monolith, but struggling with recruiting.</p>
<p>We’re all developers, but we’re not doing the same job. The line connecting a problem to its solution is relatively straight in some organizations and incredibly convoluted in some hours.</p>
<p>Processes, Software architectures and Organization are not separate concerns, neither are orthogonal. Pretending to fix one thing without touching others is a losing battle.</p>
<p>We’re part of the problem. Our software is part of the problem. We can be part of the solution too.</p>

The UX designer, the product owner, the manager, the tester, the agile coach and others can try their best to influence outcomes but it doesn’t matter if the programmer is not on board. Only the programmer decides which if-statements get written and how long it will take. Without the programmer, there is no software. Without the software, there is no company. But as the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. One of those responsibilities is to acknowledge this power and use it for good. Good for the human beings working with you, good for the company, good for your own health and good for society.</p>

                                        </p><p>When we design a system from scratch, especially complex distributed systems, with microservices and/or Big Data pipelines, we have to make a series of important tactical decisions regarding the structure and information flow within our domain. If we assume boundaries in the wrong place, or forget or omit important aspects of communication, we can end up with brittle services, performance issues, and needlessly coupled modules and components, which are painful to maintain and deploy.
Some of those aspects are hard to discover upfront, and even with great experience, it's not unusual to get the first design at least partially wrong. </p>
<p>One way to minimize the consequences of those decisions, and to verify our initial assumptions, is to start implementation not with a full architecture in mind, but rather with the smallest possible footprint: A plain, but fully operational prototype of the domain model, which we can stress, observe and explore - and change easily, if we run into problems. This way, we can actually <em>see</em> our design work, and gain valuable insights.</p>
<p>Using examples, I will demonstrate how combining Domain Driven Design with the practices, heuristics and principles of Software Crafting can highlight difficult or problematic choices, improve fundamental architecture decisions, and ultimately lead to better and more sustainable software systems, long before we get sidetracked by the additional complexity of host environments and deployment pipelines.</p>

The complexity increases exponentially . One of the developer biggest challenges is to be able to control this complexity while adding new features.</p>
<p>Several solutions exist: code rewriting or mastery of technical debt. 
The only true solution: Remove features!
This talk will explain how to lose your application featural overload by understanding the difference between the essential complexity and the accidental complexity, but also by giving you keys to carry out these changes in your project teams.</p>

                                        </p><p>Over the years I've spoken many times about what Event Sourcing is and shared many of the good, the bad and the ugly parts of it in blog posts and various talks. However, I've never talked about how to actually build a system based on this architecture style. I keep getting the same questions over and over again. Like when to apply Event Sourcing and at what architectural level. How to deal with transactional boundaries within and outside the domain. How to build projections that are autonomous, reliable and self-supporting. How to deal with upgrades and blue-green deployments. But also on how to handle bugs, design mistakes and crashing projections. Having made a lot of these mistakes myself over these years, it's time to share my current thoughts and opinions about this. Since the .NET space has a pretty rich set of open-source projections to support this, the examples and code will be .NET. But the concepts are universal, so don't let that scare you off.</p>

                                        </p><p>Some companies are going "full DevOps" and apparently releasing at the speed of light. Other companies are still struggling with estimations and slowly thinking about going microservices. Other are happy with their monolith, but struggling with recruiting.</p>
<p>We’re all developers, but we’re not doing the same job. The line connecting a problem to its solution is relatively straight in some organizations and incredibly convoluted in some hours.</p>
<p>Processes, Software architectures and Organization are not separate concerns, neither are orthogonal. Pretending to fix one thing without touching others is a losing battle.</p>
<p>We’re part of the problem. Our software is part of the problem. We can be part of the solution too.</p>

<p>Our brains are designed for making quick decisions, but quick does not always mean good… We make thousands of decisions each day but never stop to wonder: how did we come to this conclusion? Were there more choices than we realised? Did we focus on the right thing? Did we pick the right option? Are there other methods we can use to reach a better outcome?
If we improved our decision making by just 1%, overall we would achieve a massive improvement in every area of our lives, from happiness with our family to success at work. Everybody should learn decision making heuristics, yet nobody does. Let’s fix that.</p>
<p>We’re going to take a close look at a variety of key decision-making heuristics including "problem restatement", "devil’s advocate", and "the wizard". Through provocative exercises, we’re going to uncover the heuristics we currently use and we’re going to teach ourselves when to apply certain decision making heuristics to improve our chances of getting the results we want.</p>

                                        </p><p>The first model a team comes up with often leads them down a particular path. That isn't much of a problem if the first model is any good. But often our first ideas aren't our best. How can you prevent bias towards your initial approach? What could you do to break free from the boundaries you first imagined?</p>
<p>In this hands-on you'll be working on a single problem but you'll be forced to re-imagine it multiple times with different constraints. In each round you'll be limited in such a way that you'll have to get creative and come up with vastly different models for the same problem space. At the end you'll see what the power is of an enabling constraint. The Monday after the conference you'll know that with a little digging and thinking you can come up with entirely different models for about any problem space.</p>

                                        </p><p>What's the main hurdle of doing TDD in our existing codebase? The difficulty of testing the untestable code of our legacy codebase so that it can be refactored into something where it is easy to add functionality using TDD.</p>
<p>But how is this done when I have no separation of layers, no architecture and I can't even mock the database? Well let's see the workflow through a live demonstration of how tests are put in place, how the code is refactored and then finally how tests are separated into different layers of the testing pyramid, and finally how easy it becomes to TDD the new feature!</p>
<p>This demonstrates not only the basic workflow of modern development with legacy code, but also how we can leverage preparatory refactoring to gain time even in the short term, thanks to testing. Additionally it illustrates how respecting the testing pyramid makes a developers life more pleasant.</p>
<p>Code that makes no sense to unit test due to bad design is a common problem. This small example models this problem in realistic way due to its hard-coded integration with external dependencies that cannot be "stubbed out".</p>

                                        </p><p>As developers, we might think we don't have to care about humans because we work on machines. However, nothing could be further from the truth. The only reason for us to build technology is to serve humans.</p>
<p>Therefore, practicing compassion is essential for effective software development. Though many people think of compassion as something soft or ambiguous, you'll learn how compassion provides a practical framework for making rational decisions about our code with the goal of reducing suffering for ourselves, our collaborators, and our users.</p>
<p>From understanding customer pain points all the way down to the level of choosing variable names, applying practical compassion can help us craft better code, improve people's lives, and ultimately find more satisfaction in our work!</p>

                                        </p><p>The 1970's were a golden age for new programming languages, but do they have any relevance to programming today? Can we still learn from them? In this talk, we'll look at four languages designed over forty years ago -- SQL, Prolog, ML, and Smalltalk -- and discuss their philosophy and approach to programming, which is very different from most popular languages today. We'll come away with some practical design principles that are still applicable to modern development.</p>

                                        </p><p>Many fundamental ideas in theoretical computer science will still be true and important in 100 years. The halting problem will still be undecidable and appending to the end of a linked list will still have O(n) complexity. Finding similar fundamental ideas about software engineering is much harder. We will still have some development methodology, but it will likely differ from Waterfall or Agile. We will likely have some modelling tools, but they will likely not be based on UML, DDD or event sourcing. Are there any fundamental ideas about software engineering, or do we just keep re-inventing the wheel?</p>
<p>I believe that fundamental principles of software engineering are of a very different kind than fundamental principles in theoretical computer science. Rather than alluding to mathematics, we need to critically reflect on the history. In this talk, we will look at past development methodologies, debates in the field and important milestones such as the 1968 NATO Conference on Software Engineering. I hope to convince you that critical reflection on those is a fundamental kind of knowledge about software engineering that will make you a better software engineer or craftsman and that will also be as relevant in 100 years as it is today.</p>

Using Nietzsche's philosophy of nihilism, Gertz explores the ways in which our values mediate how we design and use technologies. Examining our technological practices—practices ranging from <em>Netflix and Chill</em> to <em>Fitbit and Move</em> to <em>Twitter and Rage</em>—reveals how nihilism and technologies have become intertwined, creating a world of techno-hypnosis, data-driven activity, pleasure economics, herd networking, and orgies of clicking.</p>

                                        </p><p>Great teams build great products. But what makes a team ‘great’? We have a pretty good understanding of how to improve our code from a technical perspective, but how can we increase the effectiveness of the team creating that code and designs? In the end, software is a technical activity, created by human beings, so it’s crucial to understand the underlying social dynamics that affect our code and designs.</p>
<p>We should especially try to understand the social heuristics that we are using continuously to make sense of the world. In this talk, Evelyn van Kelle will discuss why we need a shared sense of reality and how this relates to team structure and the quality of your products. Second, she will explore two famous perspectives on sensemaking, and relate them to three social heuristics that are heavily affecting our products and decisions. </p>
<ul>
<li>What you see is all there is (availability heuristic)</li>
<li>Beware of the experts (related to overconfidence)</li>
<li>The curse of first impressions (related to anchoring)</li>
</ul>
<p>These heuristics have everything to do with tackling complexity at the heart of software development. In fact, they offer us ways to deal with the complexity we’re facing on a daily basis. If we know the domain, or ‘world’ that we’re operating in, and we are aware of heuristics that may affect our work, we can safely celebrate heuristics and make the best decisions of our lives. </p>

                                        </p><p>Modeling business requirements and policies is a tricky thing. Especially when those requirements just keep on changing. Sure, we've all written code before to model requirements, but how can we achieve the dream of evolving the code and at the same time be aligned with the business? After all, isn't that the promise of Domain Driven Design?</p>
<p>Business policies are crucial and for us tech people, so is the right way to model them. We want our code to be extensible and to keep up with the changes in business. Time is also a crucial element in modeling business workflows and is implemented in a multitude of ways like timers, scheduled jobs, etc. In this talk, we'll discuss the saga message pattern to see how you can model complex business workflows, and model time as an immutable durable event so you can implement your business policies in such a manner that it truly evolves around your business. Realize the DDD dream.</p>

                                        </p><p>Donella Meadows book, Thinking in Systems, is a concise and crucial book offering insight on how to think about systems, how to control systems and how systems change and control themselves. A system is a group of interacting, interrelated or interdependent parts unified to have a purpose. Examples can be a heating system, a tree, a human, a social system, an IT system, and IT Teams working as a part in a company which is also again a system.</p>
<p>For me, the most interesting part of the book is about system traps. They are traps in where systems can go wrong without noticing. Since reading the book I started observing these traps in my day to day work. Traps like seeking the wrong goal with a code coverage threshold, shifting the burden to an intervener by letting a separate QA team be responsible for quality. Join me in this talk where I will go into more of these system traps I observed in IT teams, and what I did to get out of these traps. </p>

Using Nietzsche's philosophy of nihilism, Gertz explores the ways in which our values mediate how we design and use technologies. Examining our technological practices—practices ranging from <em>Netflix and Chill</em> to <em>Fitbit and Move</em> to <em>Twitter and Rage</em>—reveals how nihilism and technologies have become intertwined, creating a world of techno-hypnosis, data-driven activity, pleasure economics, herd networking, and orgies of clicking.</p>

                                        </p><p>As developers, we might think we don't have to care about humans because we work on machines. However, nothing could be further from the truth. The only reason for us to build technology is to serve humans.</p>
<p>Therefore, practicing compassion is essential for effective software development. Though many people think of compassion as something soft or ambiguous, you'll learn how compassion provides a practical framework for making rational decisions about our code with the goal of reducing suffering for ourselves, our collaborators, and our users.</p>
<p>From understanding customer pain points all the way down to the level of choosing variable names, applying practical compassion can help us craft better code, improve people's lives, and ultimately find more satisfaction in our work!</p>

                                        </p><p>Material on storage systems primarily covers two types of storage: B-Trees and LSM Trees. When these two are contrasted, we hear about buffering and immutability and it almost starts looking like we can't have immutability without buffering and vice versa. However, if we dig into academic and industry works, we find a lot of useful approaches mixing and matching these properties in different ways.</p>
<p>Starting from the classic B-Tree papers from 1979 to the first LSM Trees paper in 1996,
and continuing into 2019, we can reproduce and see the line of thinking that have lead the industry where we are today.</p>
<p>By revisiting this evolution of thinking and systematising the findings, we will improve our understanding of the currently used (and some useful yet overlooked) approaches to durable storage.</p>

                                        </p><p>As technical leaders we aim to help all the developers in our organizations to make better choices. How do we do that when empowered/Agile/DevOps teams make many choices independently? In this talk you will learn about a coaching technique for building up people, skills and teams.</p>
<p>In a DevOps world of Agile empowered teams, exerting technical leadership across an organization is challenging. When I was a junior to mid-level developer, the technical leaders in my organization were called Architects. Day to day, I saw little of them. The help they gave me comprised mainly of architectural diagrams to guide development work, and compulsory standard tools and frameworks. Occasionally they would hold workshops with the whole team and go through important technical decisions. These people, although once skilled programmers, did not write code themselves any more.</p>
<p>More recently, I've found DevOps to be a great way to get teams aligned with sensible shared goals, and to ensure they there is enough automation so there is time available for the important work of developing new features. I'm seeing a lot of people migrating to a microservices architecture, and gaining advantage from smaller, more manageable codebases. This is all good stuff. My biggest concerns now that I am a more senior developer and technical leader, is how to ensure the code produced is of good quality, has automated tests, and follows broad architectural guidelines. These concerns are similar to those of the past, but in my opinion the kind of technical leader we need today looks a lot more like a coach than a traditional architect.</p>
<p>Lately I have been using a coaching method that was originally developed by Llewellyn Falco. It involves first teaching each development team how to do mob programming. This is combined with a short daily training class teaching agile development techniques. Once each team has learnt mob programming, you can use this forum to coach them in their codebase. It's the most effective way I have found so far to teach a skill like Test-Driven Development. I believe you can also use this coaching method to encourage consistent use of other coding techniques, libraries and frameworks.</p>
<p>In this talk you will learn what Mob Programming is, what it is good for, and how I am using it. I hope hearing about my experiences will help you to add this coaching technique to your arsenal as a technical leader in a modern, Agile, DevOps organization.</p>

                                        </p><p>Rather than engage in endless debates about whether technologies are making us better or worse, Nolen Gertz investigates what we think "better" and "worse" mean, and what role this thinking has played in the creation of our technological world. Using Nietzsche's philosophy of nihilism, Gertz explores the ways in which our values mediate how we design and use technologies. Examining our technological practices—practices ranging from <em>Netflix and Chill</em> to <em>Fitbit and Move</em> to <em>Twitter and Rage</em>—reveals how nihilism and technologies have become intertwined, creating a world of techno-hypnosis, data-driven activity, pleasure economics, herd networking, and orgies of clicking.</p>

<p>Therefore, practicing compassion is essential for effective software development. Though many people think of compassion as something soft or ambiguous, you'll learn how compassion provides a practical framework for making rational decisions about our code with the goal of reducing suffering for ourselves, our collaborators, and our users.</p>
<p>From understanding customer pain points all the way down to the level of choosing variable names, applying practical compassion can help us craft better code, improve people's lives, and ultimately find more satisfaction in our work!</p>

                                        </p><p>There are several reasons you might want to contribute to open source software. For me, it was that I wanted to learn in a more useful way than doing programming challenges. So I looked into how I could contribute to open source projects that I use myself.
After contributing for almost two years, I notice that I have learned a lot from my contributions (which has been useful at work), as well as have made friends and have become part of a community. </p>
<p>In this talk I will share my experience with contributing to Cucumber, including an early mistake (merging something that wasn't ready yet) and fixing it with the support of core contributors, and still feeling welcome!
You'll learn how how to find your project and contributions to start with, how to connect with the community to make sure your contributions are useful and the many types of contributions you can make. </p>
<p>Contributing to open source is a way of paying back to the community. In addition, it is a way for you to learn, collaborate and become part of a community. Getting (constructive) feedback on a pull request and collaborating to make things even better is a great feeling!</p>

                                        </p><p>What if your engineering teams didn't have to be static? What if you could form them, disband them or adapt their composition every 3 months? And people could pick what they work on?</p>
<p>Is it a recipe for disaster? Or would it give you the flexibility to work on what has the highest business impact, increase engagement and develop your future leaders? What are the tradeoffs? How do you balance short term impact with long term ownership and platform stability?</p>
<p>In this talk, I'll tell you how I initially led a team of ~20 people from a static structure to something a lot more dynamic where reteaming happens quarterly, and how we are now scaling those practices to 60 people. I'll share with you:</p>
<ul>
<li>How we plan our quarters and let people pick what they work on</li>
<li>How we create constraints to make sure the important work gets done while developing knowledge sharing</li>
<li>How we use OKRs to create alignment and track progress</li>
<li>How we keep in sync and engage with our stakeholders</li>
<li>How lead time is decreasing as a result</li>
</ul>
<p>I'll also share details on our journey: our mistakes, our learnings, what we still struggle with 1 year later and why we think this is strongly aligned with Agile core values!</p>

                                        </p><p>Rather than engage in endless debates about whether technologies are making us better or worse, Nolen Gertz investigates what we think "better" and "worse" mean, and what role this thinking has played in the creation of our technological world. Using Nietzsche's philosophy of nihilism, Gertz explores the ways in which our values mediate how we design and use technologies. Examining our technological practices—practices ranging from <em>Netflix and Chill</em> to <em>Fitbit and Move</em> to <em>Twitter and Rage</em>—reveals how nihilism and technologies have become intertwined, creating a world of techno-hypnosis, data-driven activity, pleasure economics, herd networking, and orgies of clicking.</p>

                                        </p><p>As developers, we might think we don't have to care about humans because we work on machines. However, nothing could be further from the truth. The only reason for us to build technology is to serve humans.</p>
<p>Therefore, practicing compassion is essential for effective software development. Though many people think of compassion as something soft or ambiguous, you'll learn how compassion provides a practical framework for making rational decisions about our code with the goal of reducing suffering for ourselves, our collaborators, and our users.</p>
<p>From understanding customer pain points all the way down to the level of choosing variable names, applying practical compassion can help us craft better code, improve people's lives, and ultimately find more satisfaction in our work!</p>

                                        </p><p>Rather than engage in endless debates about whether technologies are making us better or worse, Nolen Gertz investigates what we think "better" and "worse" mean, and what role this thinking has played in the creation of our technological world. Using Nietzsche's philosophy of nihilism, Gertz explores the ways in which our values mediate how we design and use technologies. Examining our technological practices—practices ranging from <em>Netflix and Chill</em> to <em>Fitbit and Move</em> to <em>Twitter and Rage</em>—reveals how nihilism and technologies have become intertwined, creating a world of techno-hypnosis, data-driven activity, pleasure economics, herd networking, and orgies of clicking.</p>
