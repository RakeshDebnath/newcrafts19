The UX designer, the product owner, the manager, the tester, the agile coach and others can try their best to influence outcomes but it doesn’t matter if the programmer is not on board. Only the programmer decides which if-statements get written and how long it will take. Without the programmer, there is no software. Without the software, there is no company. But as the saying goes, with great power comes great responsibility. One of those responsibilities is to acknowledge this power and use it for good.

However, functional programming comes with interesting tools aimed at solving these boring (or deemed boring) concerns: dependency inversion, observability). Aspect-Oriented-Programming is often used for this in the OO word. \n\nA functional solution, called a _monad stack_, allows to combine all this cross-cutting concerns and behaviours with no magic (or not too much). \n\nIn this conference, we'll see what _monad transformers_ are, how they work, and how to use them to structure a web application, with examples in scala and haskell.",

Too often, it neglected by teams and left to the end for penetration testers to consider. But, it doesn't have to be. Security can be considered early in the development cycle. How can we encourage this behaviour? How can you get development teams interested?\n\nSecurity is an important skill to possess while delivering quality software. The cost of not having security skills within teams is now more obvious than ever. Security should be in the forefront of development teams minds. Even with these risks, data leaks and denial of service attacks are in the headlines often. How do we stop our companies being another statistic?\n\nLearning should not be compulsory. Especially if you want something to become part of the culture. Beginning with a simple workshop to expanding to a security guild, people were eager to be involved. This lead to further workshops which included the basics of threat modelling using STRIDE to the complexity of automated checks. Security at Sky became not only fun but cool. Security was no longer a rarely thought about requirement but a fun, oft thought about need.",

                            "description": "When we design a system from scratch, especially complex distributed systems, with microservices and/or Big Data pipelines, we have to make a series of important tactical decisions regarding the structure and information flow within our domain. If we assume boundaries in the wrong place, or forget or omit important aspects of communication, we can end up with brittle services, performance issues, and needlessly coupled modules and components, which are painful to maintain and deploy.\nSome of those aspects are hard to discover upfront, and even with great experience, it's not unusual to get the first design at least partially wrong.\n\nOne way to minimize the consequences of those decisions, and to verify our initial assumptions, is to start implementation not with a full architecture in mind, but rather with the smallest possible footprint: A plain, but fully operational prototype of the domain model, which we can stress, observe and explore - and change easily, if we run into problems. This way, we can actually _see_ our design work, and gain valuable insights.\n\nUsing examples, I will demonstrate how combining Domain Driven Design with the practices, heuristics and principles of Software Crafting can highlight difficult or problematic choices, improve fundamental architecture decisions, and ultimately lead to better and more sustainable software systems, long before we get sidetracked by the additional complexity of host environments and deployment pipelines.",

Like when to apply Event Sourcing and at what architectural level. How to deal with transactional boundaries within and outside the domain. How to build projections that are autonomous, reliable and self-supporting. How to deal with upgrades and blue-green deployments. But also on how to handle bugs, design mistakes and crashing projections. Having made a lot of these mistakes myself over these years, it's time to share my current thoughts and opinions about this. Since the .NET space has a pretty rich set of open-source projections to support this, the examples and code will be .NET. But the concepts are universal, so don't let that scare you off.",

The difficulty of testing the untestable code of our legacy codebase so that it can be refactored into something where it is easy to add functionality using TDD.\n\nBut how is this done when I have no separation of layers, no architecture and I can't even mock the database? Well let's see the workflow through a live demonstration of how tests are put in place, how the code is refactored and then finally how tests are separated into different layers of the testing pyramid, and finally how easy it becomes to TDD the new feature!\n\nThis demonstrates not only the basic workflow of modern development with legacy code, but also how we can leverage preparatory refactoring to gain time even in the short term, thanks to testing. Additionally it illustrates how respecting the testing pyramid makes a developers life more pleasant.\n\nCode that makes no sense to unit test due to bad design is a common problem. This small example models this problem in realistic way due to its hard-coded integration with external dependencies that cannot be \"stubbed out\".",

When these two are contrasted, we hear about buffering and immutability and it almost starts looking like we can't have immutability without buffering and vice versa. However, if we dig into academic and industry works, we find a lot of useful approaches mixing and matching these properties in different ways.\n\nStarting from the classic B-Tree papers from 1979 to the first LSM Trees paper in 1996,\nand continuing into 2019, we can reproduce and see the line of thinking that have lead the industry where we are today.\n\nBy revisiting this evolution of thinking and systematising the findings, we will improve our understanding of the currently used (and some useful yet overlooked) approaches to durable storage.",

For me, it was that I wanted to learn in a more useful way than doing programming challenges. So I looked into how I could contribute to open source projects that I use myself.\nAfter contributing for almost two years, I notice that I have learned a lot from my contributions (which has been useful at work), as well as have made friends and have become part of a community.\n\nIn this talk I will share my experience with contributing to Cucumber, including an early mistake (merging something that wasn't ready yet) and fixing it with the support of core contributors, and still feeling welcome!\nYou'll learn how how to find your project and contributions to start with, how to connect with the community to make sure your contributions are useful and the many types of contributions you can make.\n\nContributing to open source is a way of paying back to the community. In addition, it is a way for you to learn, collaborate and become part of a community. Getting (constructive) feedback on a pull request and collaborating to make things even better is a great feeling!",

Or would it give you the flexibility to work on what has the highest business impact, increase engagement and develop your future leaders? What are the tradeoffs? How do you balance short term impact with long term ownership and platform stability?\n\nIn this talk, I'll tell you how I initially led a team of ~20 people from a static structure to something a lot more dynamic where reteaming happens quarterly, and how we are now scaling those practices to 60 people. I'll share with you:\n- How we plan our quarters and let people pick what they work on\n- How we create constraints to make sure the important work gets done while developing knowledge sharing\n- How we use OKRs to create alignment and track progress\n- How we keep in sync and engage with our stakeholders\n- How lead time is decreasing as a result\n\nI'll also share details on our journey: our mistakes, our learnings, what we still struggle with 1 year later and why we think this is strongly aligned with Agile core values!",
